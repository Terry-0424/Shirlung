# Shir
A video player on MacOS, iPadOS &amp; iOS that can do the precise seeking and caption seeking. 
with keyboard shortcuts and comfortable, powerful gestures.
It's really useful for language listening practice.
It can modify the subtitle files directly to help improve the (because my favorite Desparate Housewives's subtitles available online are not precise at all in timeline and it's very unconvenient for me to learn English in Aegisub while modifying the subtitle files.)
and Shir is super convenient to make consecutive-subtitle screenshots for future memorization.
